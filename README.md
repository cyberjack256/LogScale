### Key Definitions:

- **Primary Key (PK):** A unique identifier for a record in a table. No two records can have the same primary key value.
- **Foreign Key (FK):** A field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.
