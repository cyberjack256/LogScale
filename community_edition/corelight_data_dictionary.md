| `@timestamp` | The timestamp of the event in milliseconds | The timestamp in milliseconds can provide a more precise timing of events, which can be useful when analyzing events that occur in quick succession. |
| `#humioAutoShard` | Humio's automatic sharding feature | This field can help analysts understand how the data is distributed across the system, which can be important for performance and data management. |
| `community_id` | A community-generated ID for the event | This ID can be used to correlate events across different data sources that use the same community ID standard. |
| `conn_state` | The state of the connection | This field can provide insights into the behavior of the network connection, which can be useful for detecting anomalies or malicious activity. |
| `corelight_shunted` | Indicates whether the connection was shunted by Corelight | This field can help analysts identify connections that were deemed uninteresting by Corelight and therefore not fully logged, which can be important for understanding the coverage of their monitoring tools. |
| `duration` | The duration of the connection | The duration can provide insights into the behavior of the network connection. Long-lasting connections might be indicative of data exfiltration or other types of malicious activity. |
| `history` | The history of the connection | The history can provide a detailed record of the connection's activity, which can be useful for incident investigation and threat hunting. |
| `id.orig_h_name.src` | The source of the originating host name | This field can provide additional context about the originating host, such as whether the host name was resolved from DNS or obtained from another source. |
| `id.orig_h_name.vals[0]` | The first value of the originating host name | This field can provide the actual host name of the originating host, which can be useful for identifying the specific machine or device involved in the network activity. |
| `local_orig` | Indicates whether the originating host is local | This field can help analysts distinguish between internal and external network traffic, which can be important for identifying potential insider threats or lateral movement within the network. |
| `local_resp` | Indicates whether the responding host is local | This field can help analysts distinguish between internal and external network traffic, which can be important for identifying potential insider threats or lateral movement within the network. |
| `missed_bytes` | The number of bytes that were missed in the connection | This field can help analysts identify potential issues with the logging or monitoring setup, such as dropped packets or insufficient capacity. |
| `analyzers[0]` | The first analyzer used on the connection | The analyzers can provide insights into the types of analysis performed on the network traffic, which can be useful for understanding the detection capabilities of the monitoring setup. |
| `depth` | The depth of the analysis | The depth can provide insights into the level of detail of the analysis, which can be useful for understanding the detection capabilities of the monitoring setup. |
| `fuid` | A unique identifier for the file associated with the connection | The file unique identifier can be used to correlate different log entries related to the same file, which can be useful for tracking file-related activities. |
| `id.resp_h_name.vals[1]` | The second value of the responding host name | This field can provide additional host names associated with the responding host, which can be useful for identifying the specific machine or service involved in the network activity. |
| `is_orig` | Indicates whether the log entry is from the original side of the connection | This field can help analysts distinguish between the two sides of a network connection, which can be important for understanding the direction of the network traffic. |
| `md5` | The MD5 hash of the file associated with the connection | The MD5 hash can be used to uniquely identify a file, which can be useful for tracking file-related activities and comparing files across different systems. |
| `mime_type` | The MIME type of the file associated with the connection | The MIME type can provide insights into the type of file or data involved in the network activity, which can be useful for detecting malicious file types or unusual data transfers. |
| `missing_bytes` | The number of bytes that were missing in the connection | This field can help analysts identify potential issues with the logging or monitoring setup, such as dropped packets or insufficient capacity. |
| `overflow_bytes` | The number of bytes that overflowed in the connection | This field can help analysts identify potential issues with the logging or monitoring setup, such as buffer overflows or insufficient capacity. |
| `request_body_len` | The length of the HTTP request body | The request body length can provide insights into the amount of data sent in the HTTP request, which can be useful for detecting large data transfers or data exfiltration attempts. |
| `resp_fuids[0]` | The first file unique identifier associated with the response | The file unique identifiers can be used to correlate different log entries related to the same file, which can be useful for tracking file-related activities. |
| `resp_mime_types[0]` | The first MIME type associated with the response | The MIME types can provide insights into the types of files or data involved in the network activity, which can be useful for detecting malicious file types or unusual data transfers. |
| `response_body_len` | The length of the HTTP response body | The response body length can provide insights into the amount of data received in the HTTP response, which can be useful for detecting large data transfers or data exfiltration attempts. |
| `rx_hosts[0]` | The first host that received data in the connection | The receiving hosts can provide insights into the targets of the network traffic, which can be useful for identifying potential victims or targets in the network. |
| `seen_bytes` | The number of bytes that were seen in the connection | This field can provide insights into the amount of data involved in the network activity, which can be useful for detecting large data transfers or data exfiltration attempts. |
| `sha1` | The SHA-1 hash of the file associated with the connection | The SHA-1 hash can be used to uniquely identify a file, which can be useful for tracking file-related activities and comparing files across different systems. |
| `sha256` | The SHA-256 hash of the file associated with the connection | The SHA-256 hash can be used to uniquely identify a file, which can be useful for tracking file-related activities and comparing files across different systems. |
| `source` | The source of the log entry | The source can provide additional context about the origin of the log data, which can be useful for understanding the data and troubleshooting issues. |
| `status_code` | The HTTP status code | The status code can provide insights into the result of the HTTP request, which can be useful for detecting errors or unusual responses. |
| `status_msg` | The HTTP status message | The status message can provide additional context about the result of the HTTP request, which can be useful for understanding the data and troubleshooting issues. |
| `tags[0]` | Any tags associated with the log entry | Tags can provide additional context or categorization for the log entry, which can be useful for filtering or searching the logs. |
